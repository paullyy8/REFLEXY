# REFLEXY

REFLEXY is a simple yet engaging reflex-based game developed using Pygame. In this game, the player has to click a moving circle within a limited time frame. As the game progresses, the challenge increases as the time limit remains short, and the circle size makes the game harder. Keep your score up by reacting quickly!

## Introduction

REFLEXY tests your reflexes as you aim to click on the circle before time runs out. With each successful click, your score increases, and the circle relocates to a random position, giving you just a few seconds to react again. If the timer runs out, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

The game features:
- A simple yet sleek user interface.
- Randomized circle positions for each click.
- A countdown timer to increase the challenge.
- A start and end screen for easy game flow management.
